    <h1>
      We chose this green to remind us of the minty feel of the morning, where
      the winter breeze can only slap our face awaken and help us with the
      upcoming dread of the day, each tingly bit on our tongue from the mint a
      testament of the reason why we must keep going, as pain is part of life
      The red was chosen as proof of our passion for the naughty lis- i mean for
      christmas as a whole. As a team of mostly atheist people, it is extremely
      important for us to always think of Saint Nicolas and his dunkey - i mean
      coke - i mean checks notes capitalism. When it comes to the white, it is
      obviously beccause each and every one of us are as pure and good as snow,
      never did we do any wrong in our life, and whoever says otherwise is a
      liar and should be getting charcol. Merry xmas ~
